<h1>Odin Flight Booker</h1>

<p>
  This is the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms">Flight Booker</a> project as part of The Odin Project curriculum!
  The project was designed to practice building advanced forms with nested fields. The home page of the app displays a form where a user can select a "From Airport", a "To Airport",
  a number of passengers, and a departure date. If any of the database entries match the search parameters, a new form will render with radio buttons for each result.
</p>

<p>
  When the user clicks the "Book this Flight", a new page will render with a number of "Passenger Information" forms that equals the amount of passengers selected in the main form. Once the information is filled out, the user can finish the booking and be shown a page that summarizes the booking information.
</p>

<p>
  I also added a basic, versioned API to render booking and flight information in a JSON format
