<h1>Odin Flight Booker</h1>

<p>
  This is the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms">Flight Booker</a> project as part of The Odin Project curriculum!
  The project was designed to practice building advanced forms with nested fields. The home page of the app displays a form where a user can select a "From Airport", a "To Airport",
  a number of passengers, and a departure date. If any of the database entries match the search parameters, a new form will render with radio buttons for each result. If not, a polite message will display and apologize for not having any flights.</p> 
  
<p>This is a very small regional airport, so there are currently only 10 flights in its data bank. But given the amount of people who'll want to use this site for all their flight needs, it's only a matter of time before it becomes a giant airline that can rival the best of 'em. I got a hot tip that there's a flight from RLA to SFO on 5/18/21, but you didn't hear it from me!</p>

<p>
  When the user clicks the "Book this Flight", a new page will render with a number of "Passenger Information" forms that equals the amount of passengers selected in the main form. Once the information is filled out, the user can finish the booking and be shown a page that summarizes the booking information.
</p>

<p>The styling is very basic and was done with Bootstrap - I wanted to keep any styling to a minimum as the main purpose of the project was to get the nested forms and attributes working.</p>

<p>
  I also added a basic, versioned API to render booking and flight information in a JSON format!
